## Data Prep for Phylogenetic Analysis
```{r data prep phylo}
# Prep seed dat by making species with underscore
seedDat[,Species:=gsub(" ","_",Species)]

# Calculating Species Means
seedDat_spp <- seedDat[,.(T50_mean=mean(T50,na.rm=T),log_T50_mean=mean(log(T50),na.rm=T),GP = mean(GP,na.rm=T), sqrt_GP = mean(sqrt(GP),na.rm=T),Seedmass = mean(SM,na.rm=T), Moisture = mean(MC,na.rm=T)), by="Species"]
# The number of sucess is the averager germ percentage X 10 seeds per replicate X 10 reps
seedDat_spp[,Successes:=GP]
seedDat_spp[,Failures:=100-Successes]

seedDat_spp1 <- copy(seedDat_spp)
# Make this dataset into a matrix
rowlab <- seedDat_spp1$Species
trait_matrix = as.matrix(seedDat_spp1[,Species:=NULL])
rownames(trait_matrix) = rowlab

## Calculating Phylogenetic Signal Using Picante Package

The statistic calculated here is the K statistic with a one tailed test for significance relative to random type reshuffling (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/picante/vignettes/picante-intro.pdf)

```{r old school phylogenetic signal, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Ensuring trait matrix order matches the phylogenetic tree order 
trait_matrix <- trait_matrix[phy_coll3$tip.label,]

# Creating a data object that matches the tree and the traits (only including T50 and GP)
MatchDataObj= match.phylo.data(phy_coll3, trait_matrix[,c(1,3)])

# Calculating phylogenetic signal as well as P-value based on variance of phylogenetically independent contrasts relative to tip shuffling randomization.
physig = multiPhylosignal(MatchDataObj$data, MatchDataObj$phy,reps=100000)

physig


# Testing if the "scenario matters" (Scenario 2 is different than 1 or 3)
# Ensuring trait matrix order matches the phylogenetic tree order 
trait_matrix <- trait_matrix[phy_coll2$tip.label,]

# Creating a data object that matches the tree and the traits (only including T50 and GP)
MatchDataObj= match.phylo.data(phy_coll2, trait_matrix[,c(1,3)])

# Calculating phylogenetic signal as well as P-value based on variance of phylogenetically independent contrasts relative to tip shuffling randomization.
physig2 = multiPhylosignal(MatchDataObj$data, MatchDataObj$phy,reps=100000)
